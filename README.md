### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Juan

I'm a software engineering student passionate about backend development, infrastructure, and AI/ML. I love building robust APIs, designing scalable systems, and working on data-intensive applications. My current stack includes tools like React, Angular, Express, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

I use this space to explore ideas, share projects, and grow as a developer. Letâ€™s build something awesome together ðŸš€
